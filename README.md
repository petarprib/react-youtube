# YouTube-inspired video-sharing platform

A video-sharing platform made with CSS, React-Bootstrap and React with the use of ES6, hooks, Fetch API, etc.

It contains most basic functionalities. Some improvements and features might be added over time.

The layout and design are perhaps undesirably Bootstrap-heavy since I wanted to spend more time and effort on the JavaScript/React side of things, but I will have more complete and CSS-dominant projects in the future.

## CodeSandbox demo

NB It is not recommended to open it in an incognito window. If you do, make sure your incognito mode allows third-party cookies.
